# ReactPortfolio
A school assignment was to create a Portfolio with React. Not to be complete, but just to learn React more. Also it was instructed to use Bootstrap. I learned to use React-Bootstrap, which turned out to be quite handy.
Here is a link if you want to check this Portfolio frontpage, which had to be made in few days: https://eevaarhipoff.github.io/ReactPortfolio/
